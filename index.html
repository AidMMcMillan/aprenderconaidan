                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Aidan McMillan and I'm currently a student at Middlebury College in Vermont. This summer of 2023 I am living in Burlington
                    and offering private and group Spanish lessons to any level of learner! During the school year, I work as a Spanish tutor with the college, furthermore
                    I volunteer weekly as a medical interpreter for migrant workers in Addison county. <br><br> After various years learning French in school, I found myself frustrated
                    with the way languages were taught in  public school. After researching methods to better learn languages, I decided I would learn Spanish on my own.
                    I was suprised that after a few months of this new method of maximum immersion, I could already hold a decent conversation in the language.
                    I soon fell in love with the language and after meeting a language exchange parter from Colombia, picked up the Colombian dialect and idioms. Last year, I studied
                    abroad in Colombia and further deepend my cultural knowledge! Language is like a key that opens you to a whole new world of culture and ideas.
                    I hope that my methods of teaching and learning can be <b>your</b> key to that world!
